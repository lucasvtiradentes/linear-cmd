- **Self-updating** - Built-in update mechanism that detects your package manager

## :question: Motivation

Why build this when we already have [Linear MCP](https://linear.app/docs/mcp)?

Because I want to be able to just paste a Linear issue link into my [Claude code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) and have it solve the problem. Currently, the Linear MCP server does **not** support using multiple Linear accounts (I use one for work and one for my personal projects).

## :rocket: Quick Start

1. **Get your Linear API Key** from [Linear Settings](https://linear.app/settings) > Security & Access > Personal API keys
2. **Add your account**: `linear account add` (Then you need to set a name and paste your API_KEY)
3. **View an issue**: `linear issue show WORK-123`

## :gear: Shell Completion

Enable autocompletion for commands and subcommands in your shell:

```bash
# Install completion for your current shell (auto-detects and gives instructions)
linear completion install
```

After installation, restart your shell or source your shell config file:

```bash
# For zsh
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash  
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can use tab completion:
- `linear <TAB>` ‚Üí shows: account, issue, project, document, update, completion
- `linear account <TAB>` ‚Üí shows: add, list, remove, test
- `linear issue <TAB>` ‚Üí shows: show, create, list, update, comment
- `linear project <TAB>` ‚Üí shows: show, issues
- `linear document <TAB>` ‚Üí shows: show

pnpm run dev                               # Run in development
pnpm run build                             # Build for production
